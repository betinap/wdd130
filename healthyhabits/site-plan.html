      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I created this website about Healthy Habits. Based on my transition over the last few years, I will show you the most relevant factors that will help you to improve your health. As I have been consulting various health professionals, I have obtained a lot of information that permitted changing my way of life, which has helped me improve my quality of life and, therefore, that of my environment. I love this change as healthy cooking and doing gym in various ways like aqua gym, yoga, and functional training. Also, I learned the importance of managing emotions through sociability, doing hobbies, and having a relaxing time. I will share all this information in this way.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I want to capture the attention people need to improve their lives from the inside to look at changes outside. For those who have traveled little in this life and for whom they already have enough life experience. But especially for those who love the simple and natural!.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        I will share some topics that will help me improve my health. I learned that a person has a perfect body like a machine. It needs fuel from food to move, whereas 
        exercise is a great way to permit us to be strong and agile.
        I will include everything we ingest in the food category, like foodstuff and natural medicine, because these will metabolize and generate an effect on our anatomy. 
        If we put good quality fuel in our car, it will have a great rate; our bodies work the same, it needs good quality food. When we ingest a lot of ultra-processing food and
        medicine, our system has a lot of work to process and generate several quantities of waste, and our system works a lot without need. So we need to ingest high-quality food,
         not necessarily expensive, so that our organisms will be efficient for a long time. 
         Regarding exercise, the benefits of physical activity are many and well-known. We can summarize them in immediate benefits such as:
         *Managing your weight.
         *Reducing risks to your health.
         *Strengthening your bones and muscles.
         *Improving your ability to do daily activities and prevent falls.
         *Increasing your chances of living a longer life.

      <h3>Food</h3>
      <p>
        When we eat ultra-processed food, we must process chemical compounds such as dyes, stabilizers, preservatives, emulsifiers, etc. All of them have an acceptable intake, so a 
        small amount will not be harmful to health, but modernity has brought the habit of buying many almost ready-to-eat foods, which are very artificial and end up poisoning our body 
        instead of nourishing it. 
        Eating fresh fruits and vegetables gives us more and better quality vitamins and minerals. In processed foods, these are lost in large quantities, so the companies add those as
        part of the formulation, but since they are artificial, bioavailability is low. So I lose the amount and quality of these micronutrients, or they become less effective.
        That is why it is better to eat less and of better quality.
        In addition, processed foods are low in fiber, essential for absorbing nutrients in our intestines. For this reason, it is healthy to eat cereals and flours with part of their
        shells, where there are also vitamins and minerals.
        In parallel, the same happens when we consume many medications; our bodies must metabolize many artificial substances.
        With this, I do not mean you should not take medication; I must use traditional medicine. Still, if the condition is not severe and can treat with medicinal herbs, they have been
        effective and without side effects. Replacing medications such as analgesics, anti-inflammatories, syrups, and relaxants has given me good results without side effects, such as
        heartburn or increased blood pressure.
        Having a list that tells us what is healthy and what is not would be easy, but if we listen to our body, it will guide us. Eating healthy is easier than it seems; the dishes 
        are simple, full of colors, and varied. And remember: all plants and animals were created for the wise use of man.

      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Some people need time to decide on their favorite physical activity. Still, the important thing is to try different disciplines while we find the ones we are passionate about or
        that give us the desired results. 
        In addition, physical activity oxygenates our cells, which favors the proper functioning of all our organs.
        Within these functions is the brain, and therefore is related to emotions. It is known that when we do physical activity, we can reduce our stress levels.
        Physical activity and healthier habits help us prevent a sedentary lifestyle installed in society. I started driving a car to transport my children more safely and efficiently 
        and stopped walking. I began to study, and it wasn't easy to organize schedules to meet family, study, social and ecclesiastical responsibilities. But within the priorities, I 
        put physical activity to give necessary time in my schedule. Likewise, if I'm going to do paperwork, I leave the car parked a few blocks away, so I force myself to walk from the 
        car to the building in question. I choose to take the stairs if there are stairs and an elevator. One can decide to make small changes to counter a sedentary lifestyle.
        In the search for the best physical activity for me, I discovered my love for yoga, the strength of functional gymnastics, and how much exercise can be done in the water.
        El ejercicio se puede usar como una forma de sociabilizar, ademas de fortalezar nuestro fisico, nutrimos nuestras emociones.
        Physical activity can work like medicine; it can heal our bodies and souls.
