                    <p>When we eat ultra-processed food, we must process chemical compounds such as dyes, stabilizers, preservatives, emulsifiers, etc. All of them have an acceptable intake,
                    so a small amount will not be harmful to health, but modernity has brought the habit of buying many almost ready-to-eat foods, which are very artificial and end up 
                    poisoning our body instead of nourishing it. Eating fresh fruits and vegetables gives us more and better quality vitamins and minerals. In processed foods, these are lost
                    in large quantities, so the companies add those as part of the formulation, but since they are artificial, bioavailability is low. So I lose the amount and quality of 
                    these micronutrients, or they become less effective. That is why it is better to eat less and of better quality. In addition, processed foods are low in fiber, essential 
                    for absorbing nutrients in our intestines. For this reason, it is healthy to eat cereals and flours with part of their shells, where there are also vitamins and minerals.

                    <p>In parallel, the same happens when we consume many medications; our bodies must metabolize many artificial substances. With this, I do not mean you should not take
                    medication; I must use traditional medicine. Still, if the condition is not severe and can treat with medicinal herbs, they have been effective and without side effects. 
                    Replacing medications such as analgesics, anti-inflammatories, syrups, and relaxants has given me good results without side effects, such as heartburn or increased blood 
                    pressure. Having a list that tells us what is healthy and what is not would be easy, but if we listen to our body, it will guide us. Eating healthy is easier than it 
                    seems; the dishes are simple, full of colors, and varied. And remember: all plants and animals were created for the wise use of man.
