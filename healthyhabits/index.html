                <h2>Healthy Food</h2>
                <p>I will share some topics that will help me improve my health.<br>
                I learned that a person has a perfect body like a machine. For this reason, it needs fuel from food to move, whereas exercise is a great way to permit us to be strong and agile.<br>
                I will include everything I ingest in the food category, like foodstuff and natural medicine, because these will metabolize and generate an effect on our anatomy. If I put good quality fuel in our car, it will have a great rate; my body works the same. It needs good quality food. When I ingest a lot of ultra-processing food and medicine, my system has a lot of work to process and generate several quantities of waste. And this system works a lot without need.<br>
                So I understand that I need to ingest high-quality food, not necessarily expensive, so that my organism will be efficient for a long time.<br>

                <h2>Healthy Exercise</h2>
                <p>Regarding exercise, the benefits of physical activity are many and well-known. I will summarize them in immediate benefits such as:<br>
                *Managing your weight.<br>               
                *Reducing risks to your health.<br>  
                *Strengthening your bones and muscles.<br>               
                *Improving your ability to do daily activities and prevent falls.<br>               
                *Increasing your chances of living a longer life.<br>               
                If you want to know how I began doing exercise, how I learned to enjoy it, how it made me physically stronger, and how it helped me relax, read more on the <a href="exercise.html">Exercise page.</a></p>
