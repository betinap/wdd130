                <h2>Healthy Food</h2>
                <p>I will share some topics that will help me improve my health. I learned that a person has a perfect body like a machine. It needs fuel from food to move, whereas
                exercise is a great way to permit us to be strong and agile. I will include everything we ingest in the food category, like foodstuff and natural medicine, because
                these will metabolize and generate an effect on our anatomy. If we put good quality fuel in our car, it will have a great rate; our bodies work the same, it needs good 
                quality food. When we ingest a lot of ultra-processing food and medicine, our system has a lot of work to process and generate several quantities of waste, and our 
                system works a lot without need. So we need to ingest high-quality food, not necessarily expensive, so that our organisms will be efficient for a long time.</p>
